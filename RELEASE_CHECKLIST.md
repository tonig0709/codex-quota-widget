# Release checklist

Every push and pull request, every version tag, and the final signed release
payload run the same gate:

```sh
CODEX_QUOTA_ISOLATED_REGISTRY=1 \
  ./scripts/release-preflight.sh "/path/to/Codex Quota.app" "/path/to/Codex-Quota.dmg"
```

The full gate intentionally mutates the current user's PlugInKit registry. Run
it only in a clean CI user with no existing Codex Quota registration. Local
development can run the non-destructive parser and render checks with
`swift run quota-self-check`.

The gate blocks release unless all of these pass:

- **Widget discovery:** the gate seeds an enabled lower-build registration,
  launches the installed candidate without registering it from the script, and
  requires the App to remove the stale path and leave exactly one enabled
  current extension. AppIntent metadata, both sizes, assets, ATS, and signed
  network entitlements are checked on the built extension.
- **No black or blank widget:** SwiftUI renders small/large × light/dark into
  all eight family × appearance × opacity-boundary bitmaps. Each result is
  compared with the same empty glass background, including separate quota and
  trend regions; a solid-black negative control must fail the same readable-
  contrast predicate, so a visible border or black surface cannot pass.
- **Live synchronization:** a deterministic fake Codex app-server proves the
  full initialize/account/rate-limit/usage path, a deliberately delayed trend
  response plus a refresh notification while work is in flight, forced port-
  collision recovery, candidate process ownership of the bridge, and A→B→C
  refresh of 5h, weekly, and seven-day data. C deliberately omits trend data to
  prove quota liveness without erasing B's valid trend. The production
  `CodexQuotaProvider` is compiled into the probe and executed against A, B, and
  C, including its default HTTP endpoint, cache prevention, unexpected-route
  rejection, and identity removal.
- **Update safety:** the bundle build is greater than every existing release
  tag; temporary DMG/build copies cannot run registration repair or occupy
  port 48193.
- **Release artifact:** app/widget signatures and `arm64` + `x86_64` slices are
  valid. After any notarization/stapling mutation, the DMG is verified and its
  App paths, link targets, permission modes, and file bytes must equal the exact
  candidate that passed the gate. Both mounted executables and the two-
  architecture slices are checked again.

The push/PR workflow and the tag workflow's required preflight both run this
behavioral gate on macOS 14 and macOS 15. Universal slices are built and
inspected on both runners; runtime behavior is executed on each runner's native
CPU architecture.

## Final desktop smoke test

The tag workflow now creates a **draft** Release. Automated checks use Apple's
registration database and off-screen rendering, but a headless GitHub runner
cannot click the widget gallery or inspect the live desktop compositor. Before
publishing that draft:

- [ ] Remove prior test builds, drag the new app into **Applications**, eject
      the DMG, and launch only that copy.
- [ ] Open **Edit Widgets**, search **Codex Quota**, and add both **小型** and
      **大型**.
- [ ] Confirm neither size is black or blank in light and dark appearance.
- [ ] Confirm the small widget shows separate 5h and weekly rings and the large
      widget shows 5h above weekly quota.
- [ ] Generate new Codex usage and confirm quota plus seven-day trend update
      within one minute.
- [ ] Only after every item passes, publish the draft Release on GitHub.
